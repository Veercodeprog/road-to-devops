# Networking Basics:

Let's forget the DevOps side of things to begin with here, we now need to look very briefly into some of the Networking fundamentals. A computer network is defined as a system that connects two or more computing devices for transmitting and sharing information. Currently we are not covering Computer Network basics, in case interested refer to the links attached below.

## Based on organizational intent, networks can be classified as:
1. Intranet: Intranet is a set of networks that is maintained and controlled by a single entity. It is generally the most secure type of network, with access to authorized users alone. An intranet usually exists behind the router in a local area network.
2. Internet: The internet (or the internetwork) is a collection of multiple networks connected by routers and layered by networking software. This is a global system that connects governments, researchers, corporates, the public, and individual computer networks.
3. Extranet: An extranet is similar to the intranet but with connections to particular external networks. It is generally used to share resources with partners, customers, or remote employees.
4. Darknet: The darknet is an overlay network that runs on the internet and can only be accessed by specialized software. It uses unique, customized communication protocols.
