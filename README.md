# Love DevOps or want to become a DevOps engineer? Take It To The Next Level With the Hands-on ROADMAP & Best Practices! 

Firstly, DevOps is not a tool. You cannot buy it, it is not a software SKU or an open-source GitHub repository you can download. It is also not a programming language, it is also not some dark art magic either.

DevOps is a way to do smarter things in Software Development. Hold up... But if you are not a software developer should you turn away right now and not dive into this project??? No, not at all. Stay... Because DevOps brings together a combination of software development and operations. 

DevOps is a set of practices that help to reach the goal of this movement: reducing the time between the ideation phase of a product and its release in production to the end-user or whomever it could be an internal team or customer.

### DevOps adoption means that you are willing to change fast, develop fast, test fast, fail fast, recover fast, learn fast and push the product/features fast to the market

Here we have designed a step-by-step roadmap to reach your goal to excel in DevOps. We have created a ROAD TO DEVOPS roadmap which has 3 Levels starting with basics to advanced. 

## Why Did We Publish it?

SquareOps invests a lot in skilling the team and demand for DevOps is on the rise but supply for the same is very limited in terms of knowledge one needs to possess to be called a DevOps Engineer. We found this huge gap during our hiring and started this ROAD TO DEVOPS Journey with candidates who we feel 
- Eager to learn and just need the appropriate guidance 
- Haven't got the opportunity in previous roles to learn and implement the DevOps process
- Want to switch career to DevOps but don't know where to start from and, 
- Have good skill sets in terms of Problem Solving and Analytics 

#### Timeline for the Entire Road Map:
- Fresher or completely New to this domain: 4-6 Months Full time 
- Intermediate or Linux Admin : 3-4 months Full time 
- Developer or strong problem solver :  3 months Full time
