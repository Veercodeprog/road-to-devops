# Observe cloud service providers. (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Heroku)

A cloud service provider is an information technology (IT) company that provides its customers with computing resources over the internet and delivers them on-demand. CSPs are well-suited for organizations and individuals who don’t want the responsibility of installing software, hardware or network resources -- and maintaining them until the end of their life cycles.

Cloud service providers are often categorized by the type of resource they provide:

**Software as a service (SaaS)** – This type of CSP provides customers with turnkey software apps that are accessed through a web browser or application program interface (API).

**Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)** – This type of CSP provides customers with access to APIs and other resources that facilitate the creation of a virtual data center capable of supporting workloads across multi-cloud environments.

**Platform as a service (PaaS)** – This type of CSP extends the capabilities of IaaS and SaaS by giving development teams access to libraries and other software tools that support building and hosting native cloud applications.
